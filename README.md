# 2dFlappyBird
Such a basic but fun 2d game that Ä± inspire from the original one.
The bird jumping space with adding force and when it hit the walls its starting from the beginning when it passes you reach 100 points.
The main thing about the game is pipes are always loading the scene with randomly so you cant go straight with your bird to pass pipes.
